Look, listen. I know *why* you're all tired of your ordinary lives. I know *who* you're all jealous of. *The Bat Man*. See, *Everyone* wants to be the Batman, so here's a little guide on what you'll need.

1. Making up exactly fifty percent of Batman's famous cape and cowl, the [cowl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batsuit#Cowl) is important to all Batmen. Every Batman has one, and every Batman needs one. Without it, you are *nothing*. Oh, and if you don't know what a cowl is, it's the little hat that makes him look like a bat. The one with the pointy ears?

2. The other half of said cape and cowl, almost every Batman has a [cape](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batsuit#Cape). Not only would you look half as cool without it, you wouldn't be able to glide across Gotham, something everyone with a bat on their chest has to be able to do. Unless of course, you're the Batman from *Batman Beyond* who doesn't need one, bacause he's got magic boots.

3. Because criminals aren't the most friendly sports, they use guns. Guns make Batman very sad. To avoid being sad, you'll need some [batarangs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batarang) to knock the guns out of their hands and punch them in the face. Because apparently that's what Batmen do for a living.

4. Even though Batman's got those very fancy cape-wings of his, he can't fly, unless, again, you're from Batman Beyond - he can in fact fly, because he's got magic boots. So assuming you're not, you'll need a [Batmobile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batmobile) to get around town, and give Robin a lift, because he couldn't afford a proper flying cape. Though I guess you *could* just use a Segway, if that's your cup of tea. But that wouldn't be very Batman-y now, would it?
