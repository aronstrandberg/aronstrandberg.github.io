**Facebook has more than 800 million users** — approximately 1 in 9 of Earth’s total population. Babies have been named “Facebook”.
72 percent of users are between 13 and 34 years old. U.S. President Barack Obama has 10 million followers on Twitter; Lady Gaga has more than 13. Twitter users post more than 200 million tweets every day.

Some say the world is coming to an end. I might feel inclined to agree.

**What do you mean you’re not on Facebook?** With one in nine people *actively* using Facebook, i.e. have logged on to the site in the last thirty days , and a number of those eight not using the internet at all, one can safely say a lot of people are enrolled. I can without doubt say that I’d be having trouble naming enough of my friends that aren’t on Facebook to run out of fingers. “Jolly good, I’ll have no problems using Facebook as texting 2.0 then”, you might say. But there’s a problem. No matter how hard you try, there’ll always be one person who doesn’t want to join. Always. This is illustrated nicely by, ironically, this Facebook group.  And if you happen to be that person, you’ll be left out. And you’ll have to join, or you won’t know squat about anything. Eventually, everyone will have to join. And when every single person on the planet has joined Facebook, the universe will explode into a giant black hole and we’ll all be killed.

I’m sure of it.

Furthermore, a large user base attracts other parties, many of them unwanted. This is mentioned in “What is Social Networking” by Karen Brown. Facebook is the world’s largest social networking site, and is bound to allure some rotten eggs, including, but not limited to, spammers, trolls and, worse, predators. In response to all this, (mostly the predators) certain law enforcement agencies, FBI, among others, have decided to sign up, using fake identities, according to the article “FBI using Facebook in fight against crime” by Daniel Nasaw. So now you won’t just have to worry about not saying anything stupid about your friends should they read it, you’ll also have to worry about accidentally mentioning you robbed the Fort Knox two days ago. Because your dad might just be an undercover FBI agent.

**All your face are belong to us**[1]. When all these people are on Facebook, they’re going to want to stay there. That means they have to put up with all of Facebook’s crazy ideas. Like changing it. Every once in a while, Facebook alters its layout. Many of these changes are unnecessary. And usually worthless. This is, again quite ironically, shown by this Twitter message. As a user, one has no effective way to express one’s opinion on these changes, and even less ways to undo or change the changes, so to speak. What this means is, once you start using Facebook and decide to keep using it, it doesn’t matter what you think of the new design or the fact that the chat function now sucks, because Facebook is king.

And the king decides.

This also means that you have nothing, nothing at all, to say about the Terms of Service. By agreeing to these terms, you’re basically stating that you accept the fact that Facebook is the one calling the shots, and it can do pretty much whatever it wants with everything you post, read, write, see, hear, feel, upload, download, sideload, frontload and backwards-load on their website. And this means they are entitled sell the photos of you vomiting on the cake when you were at your friend’s cousin’s co-worker’s move-in party. If they want to. But surely they don’t want to. But maybe. But probably not. Just maybe.

***OF COURSE* I’m working. Just on Facebook.** Since Mr. Zuckerberg’s introduction of Facebook to the world in 2004, studies indicate that the world’s average productivity has decreased by over 100,000,000,000%. For some reason, people have stopped working when they’re at work, and are instead spending all their time on playing FarmVille and laughing at the photos of the their friends vomiting on cakes. Because honestly, why would I want to do WORK, which is boring, when I can go to Facebook, which is not boring – and still get paid for it? And why would I want to MAKE FOOD, which is annoying, when I can go to Facebook, which isn’t? And WHY in the name of the almighty Allan Karlsson would I want to do ANYTHING when I can go to Facebook, and do NOTHING? Sarah Kliff somewhat writes about this in “Why I hate Facebook”. She also writes that she loves penguins. Because writing about penguins is not anywhere near as boring as writing about the recession. And I understand her. Because I don’t like doing stuff either. And neither does anyone else.

And that’s why the world will end up as a giant black hole.


**Summarize, because TL;DR.** If you didn’t bother to actually read everything above this, and instead played FarmVille, I’ll give you a brief summary. Also, I have to summarize at the end. Because anything else would be discriminating to old people people with poor memory.

Almost everyone in the civilized world is using Facebook, but there’ll always someone who doesn’t want to. This breaks the whole purpose, because you can’t actually use Facebook replace anything, because there’s still one person who’s not willing to use anything but phones. Eventually, that someone might change his mind. In Sweden, we call that “putting all your eggs in the same basket”. Which is like asking for someone to run up and smash them in your face.
	By using Facebook, one has to agree to their terms of service, and once you’ve done that and forever after, you have to stick to them. This includes accepting the stupid chat, and allowing Facebook to sell your photos.
	And by using Facebook, you’re caught. Forever. And you will never work again. Because you’ll be too busy playing FarmVille and telling everyone you love penguins.

All this ranting has probably made you think I’m very grumpy. And that’s because I am. And I don’t really like all this. But in the end, I don’t care if you waste spend one gazillion hours on FarmVille. I’m fine with it, as long as you don’t send me any messages begging for me to feed your pigs.

And as long as I don’t explode in a giant black hole.
