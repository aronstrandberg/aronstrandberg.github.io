		<p><em>Submission</em></p>

<p>Almost the entire book takes place in an Oregon asylum, and it sets the theme for the entire story. The ward is run by Miss Ratched, “The Big Nurse”, with an iron fist, and her psychological effects on the patients, as well as the staff, make sure that they never fight back, and don&rsquo;t want to fight back. With cold unfriendliness, unnerving medication, and strict regulation she sets the tone of the book, and one can see oneself as one of the inmates, struggling to get through the day; managing the aides' harsh treatment, and stop oneself from going crazy when the choice of daily activities include little more than staring at the white-painted walls.</p>

<p><em>Observer</em></p>

<p>The narrator, Chief Bromden, has been committed for a decade; making him the longest-staying “guest” of all patients in the ward. During the entire time, he has pretended to be both deaf, and dumb. Because of this, he is left alone by the other patients; for what use would there be speaking to a deaf man? Over the years, Chief Broom, as the aides call him, has been able to listen in on everyone else, hearing everything they say, without them knowing; and he has heard many things from The Big Nurse &ndash; during the meetings when he silently wards of the dust with his trusty broom, the staff speak their minds without a thought going to Mr. Bromden nor the functionality of his hearing apparatus. Indeed, he has heard many tales not meant for him.</p>

<p><em>Rebellion</em></p>

<p>Randle McMurphy, the second protagonist of the book, is the new guy who arrives in the beginning of the story. When he discovers that Nurse Ratched isn&rsquo;t going to make life easy for him and his new-found mates in the ward, he begins a campaign with one goal, and one goal only: to make life as difficult for Nurse Ratched as he possibly can. He begins lightly with making fun of her and her methods, but eventually escalates by repeatedly breaking the window that separates the day room from the Nurses' office; which the nurse seems very upset about. This behavior culminates in the end of the book, when he aggressively assaults Ratched, trying to strangle her. After being overpowered by the aides and other nurses, he is ultimately punished for his actions by being lobotomized.</p>
