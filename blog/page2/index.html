		<p>Look, listen. I know <em>why</em> you&rsquo;re all tired of your ordinary lives. I know <em>who</em> you&rsquo;re all jealous of. <em>The Bat Man</em>. See, <em>Everyone</em> wants to be the Batman, so here&rsquo;s a little guide on what you&rsquo;ll need.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Making up exactly fifty percent of Batman&rsquo;s famous cape and cowl, the <strong>cowl</strong> is important to all Batmen. Every Batman has one, and every Batman needs one. Without it, you are <em>nothing</em>. Oh, and if you don&rsquo;t know what a cowl is, it&rsquo;s the little hat that makes him look like a bat. The one with the pointy ears?</p></li>
<li><p>The other half of said cape and cowl, almost every Batman has a <strong>cape</strong>. Not only would you look half as cool without it, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to glide across Gotham, something everyone with a bat on their chest has to be able to do. Unless of course, you&rsquo;re the Batman from <em>Batman Beyond</em> who doesn&rsquo;t need one, bacause he&rsquo;s got magic boots.</p></li>
<li><p>Because criminals aren&rsquo;t the most friendly sports, they use guns. Guns make Batman very sad. To avoid being sad, you&rsquo;ll need some <strong>batarangs</strong> to knock the guns out of their hands and punch them in the face. Because apparently that&rsquo;s what Batmen do for a living.</p></li>
<li><p>Even though Batman&rsquo;s got those very fancy cape-wings of his, he can&rsquo;t fly, unless, again, you&rsquo;re from Batman Beyond &ndash; he can in fact fly, because he&rsquo;s got magic boots. So assuming you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;ll need a <strong>Batmobile</strong> to get around town, and give Robin a lift, because he couldn&rsquo;t afford a proper flying cape. Though I guess you <em>could</em> just use a Segway, if that&rsquo;s your cup of tea. But that wouldn&rsquo;t be very Batman-y now, would it?</p></li>
</ol>
